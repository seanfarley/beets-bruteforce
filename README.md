# beets bruteforce plugin

A brain-dead, brute-force search of Wikipedia for the original release of a song
to find its album. The main use-case is when importing a bunch of random, single
songs where you just care about getting the most original-ish album information
so [beets](https://github.com/beetbox/beets) can fetch and embed the correct
artwork.

# Installation

Clone and then typical install dependencies and then locally install the project.

 ``` sh
 
 ```

# Beets Notes

- beets will try to import a folder as one album so you'll need to manually send
  each file, e.g. `beets import foo/bar/*`
